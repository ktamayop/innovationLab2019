# innovationLab2019

This repo contains the sources and docs for the Innovation Lab 2019 @ Endava.

### UI Project
The UI is an angular project inside *matching-learning* directory.

TODO: Add instructions to run the project here or link to the readme file inside the UI root directory.

### API Project
The API is a dotnet core 3.0 web api inside *matching-learning-api* directory.

### If you want to work with the API follow the below steps:

  1. Ensure you have the latest [dotnet core 3 - skd](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0) installed.
  (This is InnovationLab right? We're innovating, don't you dare questionning why we're using a preview version of net core for this.)
  2. Open the solution file - `matching-learning-api.sln` - in VS 2019.
  3. Add code, build and debug normally.
  4. Postman is recommended to test the API, but you could also use Swagger UI.
